## About My Project

My project has to do with gender co-reference resolution. I am testing the gender co-reference reloution capabilities of large language models. To quantify my findings, I will be using the WinoBias dataset but swithching the pronouns used in the dataset. And then Iwill be computing the accuracy with which the model predicts the data.
