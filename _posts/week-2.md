This week I met with Dr. Ordeonez. We talked about the kind of papers I would be interested in writing. I went through some of the projects that the lab was currently working on. They all seemed vey interesting. I was going through the descriptions for all of them and Veronica, the other intern under Dr. Ordonez, toldd me about what she worked on last summer and what the other intern last suummer worked on. 

Dr. Ordonez gave me a couple of papers to read about langage - visual models. It was realluy interesting to learn about how CLIP models and language visual models work. I learned a little about the neural networks and the architecture that goes into these models. 

We once again went out for lunch with the professor and the graduate students. The professor said that this was going to be a weekly thing and I really appreciated the opportunity to try some new restraunts in Houston and socialize with the team.
