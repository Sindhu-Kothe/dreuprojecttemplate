This week I experimented a little more with the SpaCy library. I tried different types of sentences and they had different types of relations. One of the most common changes that I need to make in addition to changing the pronoun is changing the auxialiary verb in the sentence. However, a simple if statement will not suffice. I tried it and it ended up changing the whole meaning of the sentence. So, I am going to have to experiment a little more and find a way to make this conversion a little better. 

I also met with the professor and we talk about calculating the scores given to each of the tokens. We agreed upon this idea as merely calculating the accuracy is a very discrete parameter but the scores are a continuious value.
