This week, I realized that a bulk of my experiment came from turning the sentences with singular pronouns into plural. This was a problem because I would have to manually change the grammatical structure of all the sentences. This means that there were 800 sentences that I would have to go through. Unfortunately, I could not find the code to change from singular to plural online because of the inconsistent nature of natural languages. However, I learned about a library called spacy; spacy helps you find the grammatical and syntactical relationships between words. I think that I would be able to take advantage of this to convert the sentences from singular to plural. 

Other than that, I ran all the sizes of the model on the prompts now that I have learned how to use the GPU's on the server.
